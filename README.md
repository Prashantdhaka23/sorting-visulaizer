## Introduction

This application provides an interactive way to visualize how sorting algorithms work. You can choose from different sorting algorithms, adjust the array size, and control the speed of the visualization.

## Features

- Visualization of various sorting algorithms.
- Adjustable speed and array size.
- Step-by-step display of sorting operations.
- Option to reset and try different algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: 63.6%
- **CSS**: 19.6%
- **HTML**: 16.8%

These percentages reflect the relative amount of code in each technology used to build the visualizer.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Usage

1. Select the sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the array size and visualization speed as per your preference.
3. Click on the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
4. Watch as the array is sorted step by step.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
